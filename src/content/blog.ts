    title: "5 Mistakes School Districts Make with the TSI",
    excerpt: "School districts across Texas are focused on increasing TSI passing rates. Here are the five most common mistakes we see — and how to avoid them.",
    content: `School districts across the state of Texas are focused on increasing the passing rates of students on the TSIA2. The TSI, or the Texas Success Initiative Assessment, has become a vital component of the new Texas educational accountability system. House Bill 3 (HB3) has also included TSI completion rates as an essential measurement for teachers and school districts to maximize the revenue they can pull in and take advantage of the state's incentive program. ISDs all over Texas are beginning to expand TSI preparation in a multitude of ways. Let's take a moment to discuss the most common mistakes we see school districts making as they build their strategic plans to boost TSI passing rates with their students.

## Mistake #1: Treating All Non-Passing TSI Students as "One Size Fits All"

Many times we walk into a school district to see their current prep as somewhat of a shotgun approach. A campus administrator gets a list of 50 students who haven't passed the TSI and assigns all of them to attend a three-hour prep camp. Unfortunately, that approach can cause more harm than good. In that group of 50 students, there may be a handful of students who are only one or two questions away from passing. Mixing them with 20 other students who are 10 to 12 questions away from passing creates a dynamic in the boot camp in which the teacher ends up focusing all their attention on the students who are furthest from passing. The students who were on the precipice of passing don't get their needs met, and the frustration mounts.

Instead, a more effective approach is to gauge the students based on their previous TSI scores and group students accordingly by mastery levels. By grouping students based on similar test results, administrators can maximize teachers' efforts and hone in on the one or two skills some students need to master to push them across the line.

## Mistake #2: Having Students Immediately Retake the Failed Test

It seems like a smart tactic — a student is one or two questions away from a passing grade, and maybe with a little luck, can pass a second time through. But the data shows that it doesn't work. Moreover, think about the mindset of the student who, having just failed a test, is ordered to retake the TSI without any additional study or preparation.

This approach establishes a dangerous precedent because all you're doing is telling this student they're not ever going to be college-ready. If you have ever tried to work with seniors who have failed a TSI multiple times, the battle is not over the content — it's over the mindset that they should try harder and engage again with the exam. Breaking through that is extremely difficult, and it is the result of not putting the work in to help these students become more effective test-takers.

## Mistake #3: Students Take Multiple TSI Exams on the Same Day

One TSI exam is exhausting by itself. Some students are expected to take the TSI reading, the TSI writing, and a TSI math all on the same day. Research shows people have an average of two hours of peak mental performance capacity. A single TSI exam is a three-hour endurance session. Taking a single examination means students are already expanding vast amounts of cognitive functioning time.

Taking all three subjects on the same day means two of the three subject areas will not be taken at peak performance. Instead, space these tests out one day at a time. Why not do TSI reading on Monday, TSI writing on Tuesday, and TSI math on Wednesday? It requires more scheduling and logistics, but if you want your students to pass, treat the TSI with the respect it deserves.

## Mistake #4: Not Ensuring TSI Prep Teachers Can Pass the TSI Themselves

This may sound obvious, but many school districts do not recruit their top teachers to help students with the TSI. When SureScore trains teachers who will be using our materials in the classroom, we have teachers take a practice TSI assessment as part of the experience. On average, about 30% of the teachers we train do not pass the TSI benchmark during their first attempt.

If your TSI instructors don't have mastery of the TSI content, they are going to struggle to help students pass. On the TSI Math Section, the test covers Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry. Make sure your TSI Prep teachers have a firm grasp of Algebra I and Algebra II. On the TSI Reading Section, your teachers need to know how to help students master inference questions. If not, both the school and the students are going to experience a high amount of frustration.

## Mistake #5: Initiating TSI Prep Without Engaging Administrators

Teachers often do a great job of working with students and helping them understand the TSI. But teachers are also aware of what's truly important based upon the presence of administrators. It always amazes us when a district administrator claims the importance of the TSI and during teacher training they are too busy to even pop in to say hello, much less attend the sessions.

Recently, SureScore has started doing administrator training, and at some districts we even have Chief Academic Officers and campus principals attend training sessions so they can be brought up to speed on the TSI. This is vitally important. We've had school districts, after participating in the training, say they need to bring certain concepts down from Algebra II to Algebra I so they can get more students to pass. It's not until administrators are willing to go through the training and invest their time and effort that they get to reap the benefits of a comprehensive TSI preparation initiative where everyone is rowing the boat in the same direction.

If students passing the TSI is truly important, then prove it. Spend your time, effort, and intellectual capacity on understanding this test. Become an expert in the TSI concepts, and it will help principals, assistant principals, and district personnel create the right preparation strategy for their students.`,

    title: "Test Prep vs Classroom Instruction: Which Approach Works Better",
    excerpt: "A best-practices model for test prep should support core instruction and enhance a student's learning experience. Here's how they differ — and why both matter.",
    content: `With over 25 years of experience in test preparation, SureScore has had the unique opportunity to see both test prep and classroom instruction in action. First and foremost, we want to pay homage to the fantastic teaching that happens in classrooms across the United States. A teacher's ability to teach new subjects and new concepts to students who learn in so many different ways is remarkable. A best-practices model for test prep should support core instruction and enhance a student's learning experience. But test prep is different from standard classroom instruction, although schools often use the same approach.

This article outlines what an effective test preparation program delivers and how to engage both teachers and administrators. School districts that think they can provide tutoring purely through "great classroom instruction" are missing the boat on providing their students with an engaging and enriching test preparation experience.

## 1. Defining Test Preparation

Test preparation is distinct from classroom instruction. While classroom teaching focuses on introducing and building mastery of new concepts, test prep is about reviewing content students should already know and teaching strategies for when they don't have mastery of a specific concept. It's about helping a student not give up on a problem and randomly guess, but instead identify wrong answer choices and reduce guessing between two answer choices versus four or five. These simple approaches can have a dramatic effect on overall scores.

More importantly, test prep keeps students engaged on difficult questions versus randomly guessing. Classroom instruction is about mastery of as many concepts as possible, while the goal of test prep is to score as high as possible on any given test. Every extra bit counts, whether it's on the 40 yard dash, or the ACT.

## 2. Engage and Entertain to Educate

Engagement, and sometimes entertainment, is vital to delivering a quality test prep experience. In a typical school setting, if a student does not show up to class, the responsibility falls on the student and their family. In a test prep program, the rules are quite different. If students don't show up, who gets the blame? The test prep company.

Step number one is that test prep has to be some percent educational instruction and some percent fun and engagement so students will return for future sessions. SureScore practices the classroom philosophy of "work hard, play hard." We work hard first and try to be playful second while creating an active learning environment that is enjoyable for the student. It is important students view their test prep experience as different from their traditional school classroom — a place to experiment with various strategies, make mistakes, and be vulnerable about what works and what doesn't.

## 3. Know When to Teach Strategies and When to Review Content

Test prep is not about teaching new content; it's about reviewing content that students should already know and teaching strategies to try whenever they don't have mastery of a specific concept. It's about helping students identify wrong answer choices and reduce guessing. These approaches can have a dramatic effect on overall scores.

Classroom instruction aims for mastery of as many concepts as possible, while the goal of test prep is to maximize the score on a specific test. Strategies can help students learn how to take a timed test more effectively. If a student has mastery of content but doesn't know how to apply that effectively on a specific test, they're not going to do their best.

## 4. Group Students by Ability Level

Too often students at different academic levels are placed into the same test prep session. As a specific example, SureScore recently ran an SAT Prep Academy with a group of 28 seniors. In looking at their previous SAT scores, one student had an 1190 and another had a 910. It was important to separate those students into two separate classes, yet the counselor argued to keep them together so the advanced student could help the lower-performing student.

SureScore pushed to keep them separated because the higher-scoring student was on the precipice of breaking into the 1200s and would not have their needs met if the test prep focused on the student with a 910. Both students need equal support, but college admissions has gotten so competitive for Tier I colleges that advanced students require more attention than ever.

## 5. Blend Core Instruction with Effective Test Prep

When students have mastery of specific concepts like quadratic formulas or intensive annotating skills, it helps immensely in test prep sessions because no "reteach" is required. Concept mastery allows test prep instruction to hone in on important test-taking skills like time management and quickly identifying easy, medium, and difficult questions on the SAT or ACT.

Essentially, we want students taking the test versus the test taking the students. Flagging concepts so that teachers can ensure high-ability test takers get extra time to understand and master key content makes a test prep instructor's job easier because they're not having to review so much content. They can drill into test-taking strategies and hone in on specific techniques the student needs to master.

## 6. Prep Students Immediately Prior to a Test Date

The most common mistake we see in schools is students placed into a prep class without targeting an official test date. Students are "prepping" for an SAT or ACT but may not take the test for several months after the prep class is over. It is vital in any test prep session that students know when their test date is going to be.

Your test prep session may not cover a rigorous concept until November, yet some students may be signed up for an exam in October and will miss an important session. It is vital that all students are signed up for an upcoming test, and that your test prep schedule is synced with your core instruction schedule for students to maximize their scores. It helps with motivation and keeps everyone rowing the boat in the same direction.`,
